    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I’m a software developer based in the Salt Lake City valley area. I currently work at Huntsman Cancer Institute
            in the Clinical Trials Office as their Activation Administrator. My work in this role has involved developing a database
            and system to track, and distribute, information about study opportunities and statuses to our teams. I am also developing tools
            for communication with companies to minimize redundancy of work. Additionally, I interface with pharmaceutical representatives
            answering questions about our research facilities and capabilities. I have a B.S. and M.S. (Psychology, and Experimental
            Psychology respectively) and am working on my B.S. in Software Development which I expect to complete before the end of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not writing code, or thinking about writing code, you might find me spending quality time with my wife and two dogs
            (Carter & Odin) or playing board games with friends or family.

    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently looking for a full-time developer role that will allow me to spend more significant amounts of time writing code
            and increasing my skills as a software engineer. I currently work independently but would love to work with a small team in the
            future. In terms of tools, I’m language and technology agnostic. I’m most experienced with the technologies that I have listed as
            used most often (see resume section). However, I very much enjoy learning new things and thinking about different ways of solving
            problems. An appropriate tool for the use case is more aligned with my philosophy.   
        </p>
        <p>
            At work, and let’s be honest at home too, I’m a problem solver down to my core. I love the challenge of seeing a question or problem
            and coming up with a creative and efficient solution to explain the question or overcome the obstacle. I learn new skills quickly and
            independently without much trouble. Interpersonally, I get a lot of gratification from being able to help my colleagues when I can.
            When it comes to technology and development, I frequently put extra time during my free hours in to learn new things just because I enjoy
            understanding and growing my skills.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that I will be an excellent addition to any development team in terms of productivity, especially given a couple of weeks to polish
            my execution and get the feel for the workflow. I think that how fast I pick up a new role and become valuable will exceed expectations. I
            think my current bosses would attest to that. My best personality fit would be with a team or group of equally passionate, friendly, and curious people.

    <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            My first experience dabbling with coding (C++ first, later visual basic, and later still with the statistics focused language R) was around 2011.
            My exploration was inspired by the work in research that I was doing during my undergraduate and later graduate studies where the need for technology 
            to work with and even collect our research data was evident My exploration did not deepen further than that however as my plan was to enter academia 
            as a PhD level clinical psychologist. After working in the mental health field from attempting to prepare for this next step, I found that this wasn’t
            the correct plan for me as I much preferred the research process, the data, the statistics, and the technology than anything that I found in the clinical space.
            I pivoted back to the research field where I also began pursing coding and technology more steadily. This was 2019, I started with Python, something that had heavy 
            applications in data science and slowly branched out into the web technologies (JS, HTML, CSS) over time. I’ve also been working on a second bachelor's degree this
            time in Software Development, the curriculum of which requires a language focus of Java, but does have Python, C++, and the web triplet in the curriculum. My current
            full time job has allowed me to produce projects (or rather one large interrelated project) that utilize Postgresql, JS, HTML, CSS, Django and Python and React 
            (see <b><a href="/projects">projects</a></b> section).
